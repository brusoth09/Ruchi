I think this restaurant is going to be a hit when people learn about it
I found Boomers when I was driving around one evening
It was closed, but I liked the the pictures of the food in the window and the cartoon dog on their logo
I took my family there yesterday to eat for lunch
I expected more people to be there, but it wasn't very busy
The lady behind the counter was the daughter of the chef, so it's a family business which I like
My wife had the fish sliders, and my daughter and I had the cheese sliders

We also had fries
They have a lot of food on the menu, so next time I want to try something different
Maybe I'll try the sandwich Mike D had

I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day stumbled upon this tasty establishment

The bacon cheeseburger is so good it makes my stomach smile

Maybe I'm crushing so hard on this place because I just ate there tonight but do yourself a favor eat here if your around 91st ave Thomas
Enjoy
I was having a hard core burger and fry craving for a few days and decided to give in to the temptation and look up a good burger place

I have never had a slider but I have really been diggin onions lately, so I wanted to try one
Of course I got the combo for the fries
I had to order it to go cause the hubby wasn't feelin so well, so I got the food and got in the car and the car was instantly filled with french fry and burger goodness, I couldn't wait to the ten minute drive home, so I tried a slider
Holy Moly it was freakin amazing
The fries were very good also
We got home and I dug into my huge burger and it was good, but a little over cooked for my liking

I think I will stick with the sliders and fries, but I won't hesitate to order a burger again, I will just make sure to ask them not to char so much next time

I was born in Chicago, but was raised pretty much in Phoenix, but my family always talks about Chicago Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, you name it
**beef###3.0###5.0
Since I haven't been to Chicago as an adult, I figured checking out the local Chicago ish places will have to do I brought my Grandma who lived in Chicago for many years and she gave this place a stamp of approval too
She ordered the Italian Beef and it was scrumptious
**beef###4.0### 5.0
I ordered the Chicago Dog and a basket of fried zuchinni and it was divine
I would have ordered two more Chicago Dogs if I would have worn my fat pants that day
Customer Service  very friendlyPrices  very affordableAnd they have specials  50
cent sliders on Fridays and 30
cent wings on Wednesdays
YUMMYYYYYY
Cheese steak missed flavor and was dry
**cheese steak###1.0###1.0
Wings were no good 1.0
Prices were ok, service was par
Almost as good as the original Boomers
Wasn't quite there for me but maybe because I was there on a Sunday and the help clearly wasn't into working that day
Can't say I blame them though
Anyways, same good menu selections, good prices
Sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original Boomers
Needless to say, I'll be back and try them again
These guys have awesome Chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here
This is well outside our normal stomping ground, but we stomped in while in the area based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed
We did not eat anything remotely health, but everything was spectacularly tasty
Big loaded hot dogs and tasty Italian Beef it's a good thing I don't live in Chicago trouble

People that live out here in Glendale must have some pretty substandards
This place is horrible, the sliders are pathetic and compared to Chicago Hamburger on 40th and Indian School, these are total crap
Their fried zucchini was out of a frozen plastic bag, obviously not fresh
**zucchini###3.5###3.0
I don't like to trash a place after only one time going there but this place is awful
The inside of this place is depressing as hell too
Just a bunch of new hot dogs advertisement signs and ugly mcdonalds yellow and red walls
**hot dog###3.0###3.0
This place is an epic failure and should shut down and try again
Also I only had two sliders and a few zucchini sticks and I feel sick to my stomach, any other place I can handle about 4 sliders and a large side with no problem so that has to say something
