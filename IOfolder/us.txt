US Egg recently opened in the space where Blue Plate Brunchery had been Same menu as their other locations
We had the Veggie Benedict, Breakfast Burrito, Biscuits and gravy, and the fruit platterthey have just opened but everythign was good and the service was attentive

Only complaint was that teh potatoes were undercooked, but I am not a big fan so it was no biggie
Went there this last Friday, as that's my breakfast out morning
Thought I'd give it a try
The former restaurant in this location was just ok
This isn't much better
Eggs were ok, and it's hard to blow it on toast, but the bacon was so overdone that I thought it had to have been sitting under a warmer for quite awhile, and the potatoes were dry and I think out of a bag from some frozen pre cut brand
**toast###1.0###1.0
**bacon###1.0###1.0
The plates are WAY too small, and everytime you tried to get a fork full of potatoes they slid off the plate
Coffee was burnt   tasted worse then the overcooked Starbucks brand
Back to Village Inn for me
This place is alright
There's really nothing remarkable to say about it other than when I asked for a Diet Coke to drink, the girl gave me two glasses and kept them constantly full
When we came in, it was pretty busy and we were quoted a short 10 15 minutes
We waited for a bit until we heard that the bar was open so we made ourselves comfortable there
The menu is really big and honestly, too hard for me to look at
The print is pretty small
I decided to keep it simple since pretty much everything on the menu seemed to have stuff I don't like in it
I chose the Belgian waffle with a side of bacon
**bacon###3.0###3.0
**waffle###3.0###2.0
The waffle was okay
**waffle###4.0###4.0
It was filling and tasty, but it was lacking that crisp exterior that makes these big waffles so good
**waffle###5.0###5.0
The bacon was a little overcooked for my taste, but not bad
**bacon###1.0###1.0
I probably wouldn't come back unless we were absolutely starving and happened to be in this area because places like this are pretty much a dime a dozen
So I've been wanting to go to US Egg for a while but with it being so far out of the way, I just never made it
We happened upon this one last week so when the weekend rolled around, I knew we'd be visiting
Now I have seen this shopping center change so many times over the years
The old movie theater, the indoor mini golf, and now a giant Super Target and a bunch of other weird stuff
It's a pretty awesome location though, all things considered
The quoted 15min wait turned into a 5 minute wait since the bar opened up
Our waitress was awesome and brought my wife two sodas so that she never went empty
**soda###5.0###4.0
My OJ wasn't bad either so we were off to a good start
I ordered the Half  Half which is supposed to be two small protein pancakes and a skillet meal
**pancake###3.5###5.0
**skillet###4.0###4.0
I ordered the Cajun skillet to go with my pancakes and, I gotta say, I was not impressed
**pancake###3.0###2.0
**skillet###3.0###2.0
The pancakes were pretty good
**pancake###5.0###5.0
I really liked them but there was no way I could eat a whole order of them
The skillet, however, was just terrible
**skillet###1.0###1.0
There was no spice, no real flavor other than wet veggies
I hate when that runny tomato juice flavor ruins everything and that's exactly what happened here
It was just not good
Had I stopped with the pancakes, this would have been a 4 star review but that skillet was just bad
**pancake###1.0###1.0
**skillet###1.0###1.0
I'd probably go back and order something more simple next time, but that skillet was just bad bad bad

Starting a day of errands and shopping started remembering I had not eaten and needing some caffeine
I see US Egg in my peripherial next stop a booth with a awesome waitress remineniscent of my grandmother named Sue Seriously if the food had truly sucked which it didnt , she rated a 5 and thats just hard to achieve today in our country
I got the protein pancakes Sue told me she felt thatd be too much for me so she split the order good call
**protein pancake###1.0###1.0
I ate only half the half order
I loved them
Awesome coffee and a side of fruit she took my pot of coffee poured it into the to go cup fresh cream and thats it Im ready for errand running and jean shoppingWay to go
**fruit###4.0###5.0
**coffee###4.0###5.0
Fantastic
Same great food service as Tempe
This location is only a few miles from my house
Need someplace to get a bite to eat and like a plain breakfast
Well US Egg is probably your spot
This place has the makings of a good little restaurant but it falls short of making any outstanding items not to mention the decor falls flat as well
Let me take you back many moons to a era when ASU kids would go to US Egg on Mill after a night of fun 
I was one of those kids and I loved their omelet and biscuits at that time
They had a cutesy americana vibe and I thought I was pretty cool hanging there
So when I saw a US Egg near my hood I thought it would be great to take Mom and give it a try
I immediately was bugged by the decor , it is americana gone wrong and cheap I have so many ideas to fix up the place Mom and I brain stormed all the possibilities , first we would throw out the plastic tropical plants throughout the joint, this is about kitschy not an aquarium 
We would take out the cheap blue cloth booth seats and hard wooden uninspired chairs for red Naugahyde and chrome stools Give it a bunch of fun metal signs and some whimsical tablecloths and we might love it
We will let you keep the yellow walls and big black and white pics
Now for the food my low carb omelet was so bored I heard it whining about nothing to do
It was called the Dan Marjerle ,who I thought was exciting back in the day , but his poor omelet seemed to lack seasoning or creativity 
Slices of avocado don't make you unique
Daughter liked her humongous hang off the plate whole wheat pancakes , so that was nice
**pancake###4.0###4.0
Of course she loves whole loaves of plain bread so consider that
Grandma though her Patty Melt was quite tasty and it did look good, served on a dark rye bread it looked not so bad
But I didn't see or smell anything earthshaking
Can you go wrong with cheese , a patty and onions 
Service was pretty good considering it was lunch time
I liked that they brought pitchers of beverages not just a cup
**beverage###4.0###5.0
Waitress was nice and easily and quickly met our requests
The host remembered my name and went out of his was to say goodbye ,also a nice touch
i want to say I found a great little place with unique breakfasts but as you know I never lie
There is nothing like the power pancakes
**pancake###3.0###4.0
Service Very good
Both times I've been here we were promptly seated and constantly checked on
If you order a water or iced tea they bring you a glass and leave the pitcher
**iced tea###2.0###1.0
For sodas they bring two
**soda###4.0###3.0
The food also came out very quickly
Food Very good
I've had the signature protein pancakes and the choco nana pancakes
**pancake###3.0###4.0
The former are good The flavor reminds me of granola
**granola###5.0###5.0
The later was fantastic and will probably lead to an early death
It is chocolate chip and banana pancakes with a big ball of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on top
**iced tea###3.0###4.0
**pancake###3.0###3.0
Fantastic
All the portions are HUGE so come hungry
Price Reasonable
You definitely get what you pay for, and some
AppearanceLocation Let's be honest, the place isn't going to win any style awards, but it is open, bright, and clean
I don't go to restaurants to look at wall art anyway
It is in a great location with a lot of other food and shopping
Bottom Line A great joint for breakfast with tons of great food
I'll be back
I still say nothing beats Matt's Big Breakfast downtown, but when one doesn't want to wait an hour plus to get seated, there has to be a contingency plan
US Egg is a great option
I don't know what's better at this place the food or the service
We've always been seated within seconds of walking in, and our servers have been prompt to take our drink and food orders without making us feel rushed
Another bonus order iced tea and they bring a whole pitcher of tea out with your first glass
**iced tea###4.0###4.0
Order soda and they'll bring two glasses to start, always replacing one when it runs dry
Water glasses and a water pitcher are brought without being asked, which is nice
Servers seem well versed in the menu, and are always happy to make a recommendation or chat about the food if asked
The first time I came here, I got a skillet, and our server rightfully warned me that it was a LOT of food
**skillet###4.0###4.0
I could barely finish half
It would be a great dish to share if two people were in the mood to eat the same thing
On the second visit I decided to mix it up a bit, and I got a pancake plate with eggs and potatoes
**pancake###3.0###2.0
Eggs and potatoes were pretty basic
They were seasoned well, but certainly not the best I've ever had
The pancakes, howeverGet the protein pancakes
**pancake###3.0###4.0
**protein pancake###3.0###4.0
I can't emphasize that enough

**blueberrie###5.0###5.0
**granola###5.0###5.0
**pancake###3.0###5.0
Apparently they now make a protein waffle , which sounds equally as amazing
**waffle###3.0###5.0
Decor is kitschy, but in a good way
It feels like you stepped back in time to the 70s
Honestly, I'm not one to shave points off a rating just because the restaurant is less than aesthetically pleasing, but I don't have the problem with the decor that other reviewers seem to have
Maybe my kitsch tolerance is much higher than theirs
US Egg also has a lunch menu as they're open until the early afternoon, but it's not as tempting as the breakfast menu
Service staff seems happy to let you sit and chat for a while after you're done with your food, which I've found to be most gratifying
Prices are great, especially for the amount of food that you get
I'm happy to go here again and again
I am so in love with this restaurant
I have yet to order anything, or see anyone order anything, that looks disappointing
Above all, please make sure you try the protein pancakes
**protein pancake###4.0###3.0
They are whole wheat pancakes with granola, brown sugar, blueberries, and almonds inside
**blueberrie###4.0###3.0
**granola###4.0###4.0

It is an amazing burst of flavor over and over again
My advice get the full order to share or order the half and half which is a smaller portion of the pancakes with an sort of small skillet bake
**pancake###3.0###4.0
**skillet###3.0###4.0
This place is chill, welcoming, friendly, and absolutely delicious
I take all of my guests here to show off the great breakfast food in the valley
Here's how our first time at US Egg went Greeted with an attitude, Burnt toast, microwaved sausage, greasy potatoes, slow serviceWe won't be back

We have been hitting this place up quite a bit after our Sunday Church sessions
Honestly, if there was a cheaper alternative closer, we would probably go there, I don't have any complaints about the service or the food, but the pricing for what you get does not stack up
It's about 9 average per place, I am always really full and hardly ever finish my plate but it really hits the pocket after two plates, and two coffees
**coffee###2.0###3.0
So I'd say until the prices drop a little, this place is just average
US Egg located on Greenway
The service was good, no complaints there
I ordered the Durango breakfast burrito
**breakfast burrito###3.0###3.0
It was delivered in a 'gravy boat'
I soon realized why, it was soupy
The wrap was wet and laying in water
The taste was okay but, nothing over the top
When you walk into a breakfast place at 7AM on a Saturday morning and you're one of the few people there, it's a sign
In an attempt to branch out on our Sunday afternoon breakfasts my peeps and I decided to eat here
I was the only first timer
It was ok, but pretty expensive, 15, for what it was
I ordered the Arizona Fritatta
Lots of veggies in an omelet with cheese, sour cream, and salsa served with potatoes and an english muffin
The fritatta was nice, the potatoes were horrible, no flavor and cold
The service left a bit to be desired
We had to ask a random busser to bring us ketchup, jam, and syrup
I'd give them another shot, but it was just ok
I eat at this place at least once a week
Love the protein pancakes
**protein pancake###4.0###5.0
They give you a ton of food as well
Onwers always there and never to busy to come say hello
There is really no great places to eat breakfast in Phoenix for what I like   which are breakfast burritos
**burrito###2.0###3.0
I had the breakfast burrito at US Egg   and it was good, but I would have to advise them to make it a tad different, maybe with more green chili
**chili###3.0###4.0
**breakfast burrito###3.0###4.0
However, I really do like this place
It's next door to me
When I walk in   I am greeted by this lovely hostess and another nice guy who must be the ownermanager
They typically hand me a menu and I venture over to the counter
I always eat there alone
The wait staff there are all women and all incredibly nice
I like how they bring you an entire PITCHER of water and COFFEE
The pancakes are the best in town and the eggs benedict are nothing to snicker at either
**pancake###5.0###5.0
**benedict###3.0###2.0
Not a bad place I think they have a pretty extensive menu and are pretty consistent in delivering great flavors
A more than decent breakfast spot that'll do in a pinch when we need something close by with a reliable menu and comfortable breakfast food
We went here a couple weeks ago on our Sunday Brunch Day
The wait is as to be expected for any breakfast joint on a weekend but not ridiculously long
Our server was pleasant and as attentive as she could be with the crowded restaurant and her numerous tables
My dish was typical breakfast fare and it tasted like food I could have made at home
Not a bad thing at all but sometimes when I go out for food I'm looking for some extra bang or a nice treat
The winner here is actually their protein pancakes which my fiance ordered and I ended up stealing more than a couple bites from his plate
**pancake###5.0###5.0
If we decide to go back here, that is definitely what I'll be ordering for myself
Good food but TERRIBLE service
We just left US Egg first lost our ticket, then served cold food Management never apologized and refused to comp a meal
Management comped our coffee which was funny as we had the cup of free coffee from outside
**coffee###5.0###5.0
I just tried US Egg for the first time
I have the french toast with egg and bacon
**bacon###4.0###3.0
It was fine
I might go back and try something more imaginative next time
Not much you can say about what I ordered other than it was fine, typical breakfast fare
The service was quick and the staff friendly
Took the advice on Yelp and tried this place and their Protein Pancakesreally good
A great combination of granola, blueberries and cinammon in a big pancake that completely covered the plate
**blueberrie###5.0###5.0
**granola###5.0###5.0
**pancake###3.0###2.0
They also set down a full pitcher of water and carafe of coffeethank you very much
This place should be a lot busier
We left for IHOP and ended up at US Egg
I made the suggestion because, in all honestly, I don't care much for IHOP and I'm always looking to try something new
US Egg was neat and tidy and offered a decent menu selection
They offer traditional diner fare with more healthy eating selections
I don't eat healthy so that means nothing to me
If your a person that counts calories, you just may find something on the US Egg menu to suit your fancy
I ordered the Texas omelette
**omelette###3.0###3.0
There was nothing striking about it in taste
Good but nothing really sticks out over other places
A big strike against my overall satisfaction was lack of pancakes served with omelettes
**omelette###1.0###1.0
**pancake###1.0###1.0
Every place that I have been to for breakfast includes a stack of 2 or 3 pancakes with all omelette selections
**omelette###4.0###3.0
**pancake###3.0###3.0
For the same price of other joints I received less food and the quality was just the same
The waitress also failed the one test I will hold to any server no refills on my drink
I will never hold meal quality against my server as it's out of their control but I do expect them to do what they can
I don't want to ask for refills on my beverage
**beverage###3.0###1.0
Asking the customer if they desire a refill is a standard practice
It's the one thing that can keep me happy even if I am left unsatisfied with my meal
Take US Egg or leave it
It's not a place I'd venture out of my way for but it's good enough that I'd drop by again if in the area
The best pancakes in the world
**pancake###5.0###5.0
Great service the owners are almost always there making sure that everyone is happy and gets what they need
Plus free WiFi
I was so impressed with the choices
Just a bit of everything
Service was great and food was fantastic
Definitely hooked on the protein pancakes and will visit frequently

Gluttony at its finest
I came here after a Saturday morning hike because I was STARVING
I was able to order their half and half which consist of smaller two protein pancakes and half of one of their Idaho Hot Skillets so I got the Bacon, onions peppers skillet

Seriously though, it was good
Like another reviewer said, it was hard to get a refill on drinks and all I had was coffee and water
**coffee###2.0###1.0
Now don't get me wrong, they do leave the coffee pot on your table, but can a girl get some extra water
**coffee###4.0###3.0
Please
But other than that, I will definitely be back, post hike of course 
I went to US twice, and wanted to wait until my 2nd time to give it a review
We initially went when it first opened it's Greenway location
Since I wasn't happy that time, I chalked it up to opening weekend issues
Our 2nd try was definitely 100 times better
Super nice service and it was packedwe had about a 10 min wait time on a Sunday morning
Coffee was good and the portions are hugeservice was slow, but again, I chalk it up to every single table being occupied
Will definitely go backthe hashbrowns were awesome
Great Bfast
Good Service
Will be returning
I was disapointed in the breakfast served at my hotel, so went yelping for an alternative
USE is definitely worth the bit of a drive to get there
I got the half and half combo of protein pancakes and Santa Fe skillet
**pancake###3.0###3.0
**skillet###3.0###3.0

Definitely one to remember
I'm usually here for breakfast every Sunday
The food is fantastic , the service is quick and friendly, and the owner is always there making sure his customers are happy
Not the fanciest place, but the food more than makes up for it
Great prices, and great food

Have other locations around the valley too
Typical diner food
Again to be fair, as a vegetarian, my choices on the menu are quite limited
Food is awesome

The server hinted on what I should order
My boyfriend ordered the hawk eye egg omelet, it was light and fluffy, and the eggs themselves tasted like an array of wonderfull cheese
Our server, Hillary, was very friendly and got right down to business
I will ask for her every time, she really cares about her job and it shows
I will be back very soon
This place rocks
Cute and small with amazing food
I was here a few days ago and found the prices reasonable, the atmosphere homey and the food amazing
Can't get much better
The food was great and the service was fast and friendly
We had the half skillet and basic breakfast

Everything was delicious
The owner, Mario, came by ask us if everything was fine
I think this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix and we have tried a bunch of them
This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town
US Egg has great pricing, amazing food, and a super friendly staff
We've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience

First time at US Egg
We had a very enjoyable experience
Place was packed upon arrival but we were greeted warmly by the hosts and assured it was only going to be few minutes
We were promptly seated well within ten minutes
Given the crowd, I expected delays in service but that didn't happen
While being led to our seat we were greeted immediately, with a smile, by our server Amber
She quickly took our drink order
The food was delicious
I really enjoyed the Gentlemen Jim's Omelette that had an outstanding sauce on it
The restaurant was perfectly staffed
Our waitress was prompt and friendly
The breakfast was really good
Great for people watching too

We just had a great family breakfast at US Egg

There were 5 of us dining today
Everyone was very pleased
The owner, Mario, welcomes you at the door
I highly recommend
The owner must be watching Restaurant Stakeout
Willy Degel would be proud
We went there for the first time last weekend
We were immediately greated by a very friendly hostess and also the manager
We were immediately seated on the patio
It was a hazy morning and it reminded me of being in San Diego with their little green area off the patio
Our waitress Jenny was so helpful wiht the menue and knew exactly what to suggest to newcomers
We ordered soft drinks and she brought a whole pitcher
How smart is that
Saving time not running back and forth for refills equals efficiency and happy customers
We had the protien pancakes which are amazing and the skillet which is equally fantastic

I like that it's not a huge chain so there's nore of a hometown feel
It gets really busy during the weekend mornings especially, but the bar is open seating

My husband and I tried this place one morning looking for somewhere new to us
We were pleasantly surprised by how much we liked it
The protein pancakes are my new craving

Love them
The only reason I didn't give the final star is only because seating at this location is a little weird
Our second time we were seated right next to the kitchen door where my husband could watch everything
He didn't enjoy that
The food however has been great each time
If you're looking for somewhere to go I highly recommend this place
It gets busy so go early
Awesome food love the protein pancakes and great service

Five stars easy
Fast service, hot food, beautiful presentation
Loved the egg's benedict california style

The protein pancakes are to die for

One of my favorite breakfast spots in the North Phoenix area
I come here often with friends for lunch and breakfast
My personal favorite is the Sun Devil omelet
It's so good and so flavorful
Ingredients are always fresh and the food is always filling while being very affordable
There are so many reasons I love US Egg on Greenway
There may be a slight wait to get a table but once seated the restaurant is well staffed with attentive servers
I've never felt neglected while eating there
Food is excellent
I had the Gentlemen Jim's Famous Omelette with the outstanding mushroom sauce and it was delicious
The fact that the place is always busy even into mid morning is a testament of how good the food and service are
A very well run restaurant
If you want a delicious, filling, affordable breakfast, this is where you go
I've ordered way too many meat lovers scrambles since I discovered this place, and every time i get one it's so good that I can't stop eating until it looks like a scene from man vs food

Protein pancakes are some of the best pancakes I've had too

Very picky about my hash browns but theses hash browns were perfect, not overly salty or to dark, but perfectly balanced
**hash brown###3.5###4.0
Server was attentive and the restaurant was nice and clean
Definitely coming back
Food is always good, the service is hit or miss
Fast seating, clean, and good prices
Went to US Egg for a change up from the hotel breakfast as eating the same breakfast for 6 days straight did get tiresome even though it was great each day
Wellwe should have maybe made it 7 days at the hotel, the service and food were mediocre but the coffee was awful
**coffee###1.0###3.0
By no means are we Starbucks people and usually find better coffee at smaller diners but was sure wrong on this one
**coffee###4.5###3.0
The menu did allow us to try chicken and waffles but even that was pretty standard
Came in around 945 am on a Sunday though there was a wait it was less then 10 minutes which was nice since I was starving
I had the Meat Lovers Skillet which was hash browns topped with cheese, egg, sausage, ham, bacon, a country fried steak gravy
**bacon###3.0###4.0
**sausage###3.0###4.0

It was DELICIOUS huge
I was only able to eat about half
I will definitely be returning
Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our waitress wasn't the best
She never asked my husband if he wanted more orange juice which he finished before his dish got there
**orange juice###4.0###5.0
Luckily he had water
Other then that though, it was a good experience
What can I say about a restaurant that serves the most popular breakfast foods
Well I'll start with the service
The owner is outright an awesome host
He gave us the best server Emily that any establishment could ever have as a server
She alone made my Phoenix morning
I wish we could have more professional servers like her in California
Now the food
Best pancakes ever
**pancake###4.0###5.0
I repeat
The best pancakes ever

Just give the protein pancakes a try

Any version of the protein pancakes are awesome

The bonus is the bacon AKA breakfast candy

When I come back, I'll come back every time
We had been here before it was US Egg and it was awful
We tried it today after Easter service with my mother and it was terrific
I had the high protein pancake and it was great
**protein pancake###4.0###5.0
My mom's corned beef hash was good   a large serving
The hubby's omelet was a good serving and fresh
The coffee was not swell but the food made up for it

Nice friendly staff and great service
It was a Sunday afternoon at about 1030 AM 
I had 12TWELVEhungry family members visiting me from out of town
Half wanted to cook breakfast at my house
The rest were ambivalent
After whiffing on lunch the previous day , I needed a place to come through
Enter US Egg
I'd long been a fan of their Tempe location, but service can vary greatly from one branch to the next
I called and got the owner
He said it was his busiest time of day but once we arrived he could seat us in approximately 10 minutes
He kept his word
The service was fast and efficient, if not overly friendly 
My Texan omelette was hearty and satisfying
**omelette###4.0###5.0
The rest of my family raved about the protein pancakes, and they were very accommodating to my gluten free sister
**pancake###4.0###5.0
All 12 of us left in a wonderful food coma
Having failed spectacularly the previous day to find a decent brunch spot, I needed to find a place to deliver me from the harsh judgement of my siblings regarding my ability to pick local restaurants
US Egg saved my ass
Bravo
The owner, Mario, sucks
He is rude and assumes the worst from people
That being said, good place to enjoy food, but I'll never go back because of the way he treated me and other people
All he cares about is money
Great service, great menu, fast and friendly service as well as affordable
Tried the protein pancake on recommendation from a great friend she was right best pancake I have ever had bar none
**pancake###5.0###5.0
If you love breakfast this is where you should be give it a try, you will see me here again and again
I've been to this place 5 or 6 times now in the last 3 months and for good reason, the food is awesome
I've sampled some of the burgers and they have been unique and tasty every time
I never 
Order a chili burger but their's had fries in it so I had to try it
**chili###3.0###2.0
It did not disappoint
They aren't as cheap as if you we're going to Denny's but it's worth the price and the basic breakfast platter is a steal at 8
They have some of the best bacon I've ever had
The last time I went I tried one of their famous protein pancakes, with granola, and blueberries, and it was sooo good
**blueberrie###5.0###5.0
**granola###5.0###5.0

I don't even like blueberries in my pancakes
**blueberrie###3.0###1.0
**pancake###3.0###2.0
You even have your choice of ordering half of one of their yummy skillet breakfasts with a protein pancakes which let me tell you is the best of everything
**pancake###3.0###3.0
**skillet###3.0###3.0
It's 10 and some change but worth it and very filling
This is making my mouth water
Looking forward to my next visit
A great find nearby and certainly worth the trip
I had the power pancake which was huge and filling and definitely worth trying as stated on the menu
**pancake###4.0###5.0
A side of bacon with that proved to be filling enough to get me through the day
**bacon###4.0###5.0
Hubby went with his standard omelet, of cheese
Nothing too thrilling but he did say the hash browns were under seasoned which is a big no no in both of our books
**hash brown###2.0###1.0
Seems like a family place and overall a good experience
Love US Egg My dad and I go once a month
Usually have an omelet but have had chicken fried steak as well as the BLT
**chicken fried steak###3.0###4.0
Always friendly and wanting to go back
Food is great
