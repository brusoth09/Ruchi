Caps occupies the building I had my first Mexican Food in Phoenix
It use to be called TJ Hannigans
We went there every Friday for years
Fast forward 24 years
This is still a local bar where most of the people know each other
The bar side is basic with all the necessary equipment
The dining room has gone through a little make over but would not be a place to go to impress someone
It is clean and comfortable
The service can be slow but they are usually more then nice and really do a great job
I have had the Pizza, wings and burgers
**pizza###3.0###
**burger###3.0###
All three are excellent
The Pizza has a good crust and great flavor
**pizza###5.0###
The wings are really good grilled
The burgers are fresh beef, hand pattied, 12lb or 13lb
**burger###4.0###
Cooked on open flame and made to order
Frys are thick cut
The prices are just right for the atmosphere and low for the quality of food
Totally bummed about the last visit
The waitress seemed hurried but I know it is her style
Forgave youThe burger was not fresh but seemed frozen
**burger###4.0###
Not forgivenThe burger was not med rare as requested but darn near well
**burger###3.0###
Not ForgivenThe slaw on the burger was better then I could imagine but maybe it is because the burger needed something to help it
**burger###3.0###
Please do not let me down next time
I need a good burger joint close to homework
**burger###5.0###
I have stop at this sport bar numerous times for myself but last fight night I decided to order out for most items
We went to Julio G's for cheese dip, chips and fiesta platter
**chip###3.0###
All were good
I choose Wings and Pizza from Caps
 I couldnt be happier with the reaction from my friends, hell they blew through the pizza and wings first
**pizza###4.0###
There sauce is great, pizza or wings
**pizza###5.0###
Everyone asked where I had bought them
Anyone that loves good hot wings needs to stop and try them
After they grill them ask to have them put back in hot sauce, thats the key
If you know of better ones I would like to go there
Please share
35 starsI like the decorWas impressed when the server asked how I want my burger done so i really didnt mind, and happily munched away on it
**burger###3.0###
Their pizza oven wasnt working I didnt mind bc i had been craving a burger anyway, but then the side I chose was potato salad, and they didnt have that either no biggie tho
**burger###3.0###

The bar was full of what must be thier regular mid day happyhour customers, an older working class crowd that must work in the buildings around CAPS
We had hoped to sit up at the bar, but they had it all on lock down, so we scored a high rise table insteadservice was good, they checked on us often, and we had a pitcher or beer at a reasonable price
Id go back again
Id like to try thier pizza, when the oven is working of course 
**pizza###4.0###
The place was clean, the wait staff attentive and the food was good
I tried the pizza, it was a small personal sized thing with plenty of toppings and cheese
**pizza###3.0###
It totally hit the spot
The price was great too
I think it was less then 5
The captain and coke was poured perfectly and complimented my pizza

LOL35 stars
This place is fantastic for a sports bar dinner
I come in and sit down
I'm greeted promptly
Then they arrive very fast with my drink order
The food is great
Dinner specials are second to none
I can't get enough of their prime rib special
For less than eleven bucks, you can't go wrong
They're appetizers are also tasty
I prefer the clam strips
They're bigger than most places and juicy
Did I mention they have cheap beer
Something like 3 a bottle for imports, and quite a selection of imports
Overall, this place is cool for a quick bite or meal and an inexpensive beer
Used to go here a few years ago when it had a different name and the food was very good and drinks were cheap
Went here bout a month ago with my girlfriend and it was veryyyyyy bad
It was around happy hour and the bar itself was packed,
wee wanted to play pool, so we hung out in the front of the restaurant area
It took at least 10 minutes for the server to get to us, as she was very busy talking with the regulars
When she showed up, she asked quickly for our drink order and left before we could get menus
It took another 10 15 minutes for her to bring our drinks and then 5 minutes for her to get back with menus
We waited 30 minutes for a burger and a Philly cheese steak
**burger###3.0###
My burger was WELL DONE instead of med rare to rare and my dates Philly was really dry
**burger###1.0###
Fries were cooked to death
Altogether, a strong warning not to return
Best
Ribs
Ever
Seriously, it's hard to find fall of the bone tasty ribs in Phoenix but somehow this is the place for them
My server was Tonya and she was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled and checked on us throughout our meal
The decor is simple but comfortable and overall has a great vibe to it
I can't wait to go back
This is a great sports bar for drinks and food
I highly recommend it
Good place for a drink   that's about it
Nothing exciting here   service was good   have never eaten here so   My wife and I stop in a few times a year on our nightly walk
We have not brought the kids   clean enough but, just doesn't have the family vibe
There are basically 3 bars near my house
Out of those 3, this one has the best selection of brews, they introduced me to Deschutes Red Chair, and for that I cannot thank them enough
**brew###5.0###
Its fairly basic bar food, When I go my husband and I spit the cajun wings and I get a club
I've never been dissapointed with this at Caps
The service is friendly, and I think everyone at the bar knows one another, very cheers esque
16oz PBR   Happy hour 150
I'm going to partake in a few
New wall of TVs for all the MLB games as well as the upcoming college season
Check out the great selection of premium whiskey's, the owner is a bit of a cone sure
Wings are just okay
Nothing to really talk about, they were just there
Beers are CHEAP a shock top is 150what the deuce Yeah i will be back
What a fun place
Seems like a regular group for happy hour
Drink prices are awesome, next time we'll try the wings
It's cleaned up ALOT Haven't been in years but just may go back
Great, cheap dive bar
Good beer prices
Wings are good, but take a long time 
Service is less than impressive
There's lack of organization
They try to take the wrong food to the wrong table and there are no real assigned sections
We recommend sitting at the bar
That's where you will get better service
Also, if you don't see a white cube parked in the lot, keep on driving
**cube###4.0###
The cube belongs to Bree, one of the bartenders
**cube###4.0###
She is the only real positIve thing about that place
She is really nice and always smiling
The other two bartendersservers that we've seen are not all that
I suppose it depends on what you get, maybe some meals are better here but my chicken sandwich was public school cafeteria level with a little bit more spice
**chicken###3.0###
I would have rather had McDonalds
The waitress also heavily exaggerated the portions
M wife got the appetizer sampler which was much smaller than advertised and we were told the Super Nacho plate was HUGE
It was decent I guess and probably the best of any of the dishes we had
Won't be returning anytime soon
If you're looking for a quiet spot to get a beer and watch some sports, this is the place
My girlfriend and I found this place on yelp when looking for a close dive, and this is our new spot
The beer is cheap, food is good, and you have to have respect for an owner who goes out of his way to introduce himself and make you feel welcome
We will definitely be going here more for the friendly atmosphere and great prices
All this time I was trying to find a nice quiet spot with a pool table, I was mad that I didn't notice the pool table till we were leaving
Next time
Great atmosphere Management is great and food is delicious Love that there is a juke box that is played throughout the restaurant rather than a radio station
Lots of bars and restaurants do chicken wings but putting out the perfect wing that is another story I've been here a few times and absolutely loveeeeeee their wings
**chicken###2.0###
So this review is NOT about the bar or the other food they serve, it is solely based on their wings
That being said the majority of their food is excellent and above average for bar type food
I cannot find anything wrong with Caps
It is never too crowded or crazy, never too loud or dark, it is a great spot for drinks, good food and socializing
Now back to their wingsI can't even think about this place without an insane craving for their wings
They have the perfect wing
They just the right level of sauciness, at very reasonable prices
Plus he wings are usually prepared quickly, although any wait is well worth it
THE BEST OF THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS ON THE PLANET Served piping hot, perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside
**chicken###5.0###
The wings are amazing
Seriously if you want to try something that is out of this world get the wings the way you normally enjoy them and then ask to get them grilled
OMG
You'll never have wings crispier or juicier than this
The wings are amongst the best I've had and I've had wings across the country and just ask my wife, I can be very critical of wings
Caps wings are seriously addicting
delicious wings
FOOD You can get your wings dry or soggy or even better get them grilled
Mouth wateringly delicious
Very very flavorful
The texture of the wing is spot on
PRICE SERVICE The staff is always nice reasonably attentive
AMBIENCE Awesome neighborhood atmosphere CONCLUSION Good size and the portions FANTASTIC wings
I am a wing guy, and VERY particular about my wings and these wings are GREAT
went into the restaurant part with my two young kids
waitress was nice and sweet
she was attentive and was really good with the kids
but that is about as good as it got
the portions were small
actually they were meager to be truthful about it
and I ordered some cottage cheese for my children wich was rancid and sour
the kids ordered off the kids menu
a 1 year old and a 3 year old
keep in mind the portions were so small that I had to order a large basket of fries to just keep the lil ones happy my hamburger bun had mold on it
**burger###2.0###
**mold###2.0###
I was so frustrated I just picked the mold off and ate the burger wich was 1199 and came with maybe a dozen fries what a waste this place used to have large portions great food and reasonable prices

I WILL NOT BE RETURNING
Good, simple American food, excellent friendly staff, good atmosphere, fair prices
Oh Caps
I used to love you
You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service
Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family
We'd eat breakfast and watch football
Everyone was so accommodating, and friendly
They would put the game we wanted to see on next to the table we were sitting at
Food was great
Service excellent
This year, totally different story
Last week we went at dinner time for the NFL opening game
The service was horrible
They weren't even busy but our order was wrong, and we got over charged
We thought we'd try again this morning, and again were disappointed
They won't change the channels of the TV's, and they don't play every game
If they don't have your game on you are out of luck
Really a bummer because we used to love this place
We get together with our good friends at least 3 times a month and we needed a new place to meet
After finding this location on the web we decided to check it out and Im so glad we did
First off, we are all germophobs and the place was really clean
It wasnt crowded in the dining area so we were easily able to get a table, wait a booth, with no waiting
Our waitress was THEE best waitress I've ever had
Extremely attentive and very sweetThe beer prices were amazing and the wings were fabulous
We will never return to our old sports bar again
I found this place on yelp and it had a good ratings
I just had to take my girlfriend to this place and see what it's about
Overall great food, good service and a filling dinner
I will be back for sure
My girlfriend also really enjoyed it
My wife and I are new transplants to Phoenix
We went here after our friends recommended it, what a mistake
When the frumpy server finally took our order she was full of attitude and not welcoming
It was very hard to get her attention when needed, she seemed pre occupied and uninterested in our needs
Our portions were quite small for the price as well
The wings were good but not worth going back to the abhorrent service
First time here, very nice, clean place
Great surf and turf special for Saturday night
Not to mention very reasonable drink prices with happy hour all weekend
Will be back
I have frequented this establishment several times, its been a few different bars over the last decade the new one is very clean great service but the menu needs to get a little better the food does not stand out, get a BLT sandwich with microwave bacon just doesn't cut it
**bacon###2.0###
**sandwich###2.0###
The pizza has always been good but the entire menu needs to be revamped
**pizza###5.0###
Great place to go have a drink though
After reading the mostly good reviews, my wife and I packed the kids in the truck to try Caps
We should have stayed home
There was one other table seated that was finishing up their meal
The server was good at first, offering me samples of a couple beers so I could choose one
Things went downhill quick from here
Shortly after we ordered food, we were the only table seated in the dining room
The wait for our food which consisted of chicken fingers, a burger , and a dozen wings was nearly 30 minutes
**chicken###3.0###
**burger###3.0###
Wings were ok, about as good as the ones I make at home
The chicken fingers   well you can't really mess them up without trying
**chicken###2.0###
The burger was beyond well done and into the charcoal stage
**burger###4.0###
Why would you serve this burger to paying customers
**burger###3.0###
Since the server didn't come back to check on us, my wife went to find her about the burger
**burger###3.0###
And find her she did   playing with her hair at the bar
So much for food handling   I should have paid attention to the thumbs on the plate when my food was brought to the table
At no time did my wife notice the server washing her hands after they were all in her hair
We ended up with half the family eating in the restaurant, and the other half of the family eating the wings that we took to go 
The empty tables in Caps should have tipped me off, but I was hopeful
We left disappointed
First timer here from Pittsburgh and this place was fantastic
The wings were some of the best I've ever had we had was very friendly
Also, Dave seems like a dude who would love to smoke some beers with you after work
Very friendly owner
Good things all around
CAPS FTB
The wings were hot and spicy, the service was great, lots of draft brew to select from and well placed flat screens
**brew###2.0###
If you are in the area it is worth stopping in
Hard to locate from the road so look for their sign
This place is fun to go shoot free pool and watch football and they have great pizza and wings
**pizza###5.0###
However the wings do not come with ranch, carrots and or celery unless you pay extra
I think it would be nice to have the option to get them free with original order of wings like any other place I get wings at
