Went here late the other night to get a bite to eatI thought this place was open 24hoursI was wrong, got kicked out at 3amnot quite kicked out but the manager kept hinting that we would have to go soon
Would not suggest eating herethe service was OK, except the waitress got my order wrong
In general the restaurant was clean
I got the turkey club sandwichit was quite stale, and did not taste very good, the seasoned fries were OK my date for the evening got a saladwhat else is new rightanyhow she ate it all so it must have been OK
I have experienced better not very impressed with this location
My friend and I came in some weeks ago, about end of August after attending a funeral service on that side of town
The service was overall bad, and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend
So we flagged down the manager to complain
The result was that he explained that the district manager was there and the ice machine was done
I was like thinking, my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him, so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me, but oh well, they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotion
**pie###5.0###
When we checked out, it took 12 hour to pay the bill, in addition, NO Pieces of Pie were comped out
Explanation    the types of pie we chose were not in the free offer, although we had asked the server about the time limit on the free pie, I guess he would not let us in on the secret that the TYPES we chose were not free, and now, in addition to NOT getting comped as a nicety for the arguing, we weren't even given ANY free pie at all
**pie###3.0###
They gave us ONE free 2 iced tea
**iced tea###3.0###
And TOOK an extraordinary long time to do this
We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad, lol
Overall, I would avoid this location
There are plenty of other restaurant choices nearby when I am on this side of town
My husband I have been coming to this Village Inn since 2008
We really enjoyed it
The food there is excellent and the service is good
I love the new look they have now
They remodelled the inside of the restaurant since last year
It looks fantastic
I love the new colors too
Great place
The food is a bit better than Dennys and the pie selection is nice
**pie###5.0###
They are always cool with my kiddo he's delayed and sometimes can be a bit much to handle
But the inside is nice, seems newly decorated
I've been about five times and will surely go back
The chocolate silk pie is really really yummy

We are used to snappy service and a clean restaurant at VI
This VI had neither
430 on a Sunday afternoon shouldn't be too busy and in fact there were maybe 3 parties in the whole restaurant but getting waited on was a challenge
Forget refills on drinks
And I actually had to walk into the kitchen to tell the staff that we were ready to order pie 
**pie###3.0###
Finally got waited on by another server who was taking over for our waiter who was on break We got our desserts and our bill which included about 3 items we hadn't ordered
We brought that to the attention of our waiter who was back from break and acted like he had caught it and had corrected it
NOT
We had to wait for a new bill
That's just my commentary on the service
I won't bore you with the cleanliness issues
The staff and apparently the management aren't interested in making money
We won't be back
This location's staff demonstrates exceptional customer service
The hostess was friendly and apologized she did not have a booth available for our request
We assured her a table would be fine and was greeted by another friendly and very helpful waitress explaining their VIP all day breakfast Special
The manager put the icing on the service when he personally wrote a 5 value for us on his business card when he was out of the original 5 gift card when a 25 gift card is purchased
We will return again and again to enjoy good food with great service 
Service was good even though we were in prime time
Good food as well
I went with the standard eggs, bacon, pancakes combination and everything came out in a timely manner at a proper temp
**bacon###4.0###
The atmosphere was standard issue for Village Inn, which to say is casual
Even though it was a weekend we still did not have to wait for a table and our waitress was pleasent and well spoken
We have been thinking about breakfast and decide village inn
Was on Sunday and busy morning,wait was 20 mins
There was party of four
We order our breakfast and did not take that long
Food was good,just relax morning to go out and not have to cook this meal
Pancake was good
Drinks good
Waiter was good
Food taste good
Three stars,I was looking at some tables that have not been clean up while people are waiting for tables
Get busy clean up busboy
Timed it and took ten mins to get tables done
That is managers job to bark
I would come back again in near future
Went here for a late breakfast around 113012ish and it was surprisingly busy
I was with other people and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table but it thankfully went by fast
The menu is huge and the prices are good, especially for this place
The inside was actually nice and the place was very easy to find and also there is tons of parking
We didn't have to wait too long for the food which was nice since we ordered all different things
I got an omelet and it was actually really good
