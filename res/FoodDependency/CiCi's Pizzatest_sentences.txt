I dropped in here for my first visit to this CiCi's, mostly to compare it to the one on Thomas Rd that I visit regularly
I was greeted by a friendly hostess got situated into a comfortable booth
The house soup was good , as was the pre tossed Bit Ranch salad, one of two styles available
**salad###3.0###

A number of pizza types are always out at CiCi's, and the taste varies from blah to very good
**pizza###5.0###
They do well with pepperoni, especially the deep dish square cut style, if you don't see it out, you can ask them to cook one up
**deep dish###4.0###
**pepperoni###4.0###
Three TVs blabbing away was a big Minus for me I'm here to EAT, thank you
The Thomas Rd store is quieter, also set up better, in my opinion, so from now on I'll stick with that one, between these two
My friends I all agree that CiCi's pizza is better than that at Peter Piper or Pepi's, and this buffet is an amazing value at 499 
**pizza###5.0###

I think the other guy was kinda harsh, this place is kept fairly clean, and you can't be at the price
Ordering to go is the real deal in my eyes, we ordered 6 large custom pizzas, a large order of cheesesticks, and a large order of cinnamon rolls for 42 dollars flat Perfect for fight night with the friends
**pizza###3.0###
They made everything fresh, did not skimp, and had me verify that every single pizza was correct and looked ok
**pizza###4.0###
They always have a friendly staff, and are always fairly tidy
Yes the crowd sometimes can be a little off the normal, and the pizza is not always glamorous, but it's very cheap, and top rated for healthy dining in mens health magizine
**pizza###3.0###
The manager is a nice guy, we have talked to him a few times before, and he runs a good establishment, and seems to keep the staff in good spirits help when needed
I think the guy below kinda shaftd them on the stars so I gave them a extra one
You can have them make you anything you want, but my top 3 favorite pizza's are the deep dish pep, the macaroni, and the buffalo wing sausage are tied for 3rd
**pizza###3.0###
**deep dish###3.0###
The also have white pizzas that are a healthier option I believe
**pizza###3.0###
Overall it's a good plce for a fast easy and cheap meal
I hope you guys enjoy it
CiCi's was one of the places I was really excited to go to once I moved to AZ from WA because they always played commercials for them but there aren't actually any restaurants in Washington
It was smaller than I expected it to be but not having any other comparison I'm not counting that as a bad thing
The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and made sure we knew what our options were for dining and she gave us her name in case we had any questions
Pretty good service for a buffet if you ask me
**buffet###5.0###
Being as I had never been to a CiCi's before and that I was really hungry when I went, I tried pretty much everything they had to offer
I had a couple different types of pizza, both of which were very good I thought
**pizza###5.0###
They had just the right amount of sauce and cheese
The amount of toppings kind of depended on which piece you picked, some had a lot, some had just one or two toppings on the entire piece
The salad was good as well, I had the pre made Italian style one
**salad###5.0###
I liked it, I would have liked to have had croutons either already in the salad or the option to add them but it's not a deal breaker so I got over it
**salad###2.0###
Moving on to my favorite partdessert
I had one of each of the three desserts they had out and I enjoyed all of them
The brownies were nice and soft and had a good flavor
The apple crumb pizza thing tasted JUST like apple pie but in a less messy, smaller serving size
The sticky buns were my favorite though
They were very light and fluffy and had just the right amount of frosting, not too much that you had a sugar overload but not so little that you feel like you're eating a biscuit
I left feeling very satisfied with myself for getting good food for such a cheap price and I will definately be returning in the future
The staff was very nice and helpful and the resteraunt was clean
The food was ok, but what can you expect from a 4 buffett
If you clicked on this review
I know you aren't expecting a night of fine dining
It's CiCi's pizza for crying out loud
There are much better pizza joints in the valley
The pizza there isn't much different then pizza you can get at the store
**pizza###3.0###
Its not going to knock your socks off by any means
Plus side, it is a buffet
**buffet###4.0###
It's a good place to take the kids after school so they can pig out on pizza on the cheap
**pizza###2.0###
Even if it is a bootleg version ofPeter Piper and Chuck E Cheese
And really u should only go in there if you have a kid
If I see a grown ass man in there by himself eating pizza
**pizza###4.0###
Im going to be wondering if he's in violation of his paroleprobation if you know what I mean
And if I see a couple in there on a date
Then im going to guess whoever thought of going to that place for a date
Is planning on dumping the person they asked
Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
Walk in, waddle out
I love Cici's
The only spot in town where you can grub on 10 different pizzas and salad for only 650
**pizza###4.0###
The desert pizza is outstanding The area gets a little rough at night, so make sure you finish up your mass consumption of food by sundown
Always friendly, ready to take request for any kid of pizza
**pizza###3.0###
Restroom could use a little bit more of cleaning
As far as pizza goes, Cici's is fair
**pizza###2.0###
The 5 stars is for the treatment my 4th grade students received when we went there on a field trip
You may be asking yourselfA field trip
To Cici's Pizza
Why yes It's all about FRACTIONS
This is our yearly field trip to close out our unit on fractions
The kids pay 300 and they get a fairly good sized pizza and a drink
**pizza###5.0###
They also get a tour of the kitchen
When they finish their tour, they are allowed to build their own pizza
**pizza###4.0###
They can put pepperoni's on their pizza however they would like
**pizza###3.0###
**pepperoni###3.0###
They were kind enough to accommodate my student who is a vegetarian and gave her a few veggie options to choose from
I also asked them to cut each pizza into different fractional partssome were cut into 6, 8, or 10 pieces
**pizza###2.0###
Each kiddo had to then calculate how much pizza they had eaten and other fun stuff
**pizza###4.0###
Now for the 5 starsthe staff
They were SOOOOOOOOO friendly and were eager to share their jobs with my kids
They encouraged them to ask questions and were just plain awesome
My kids and I had an amazing time
The pizza was delicious, as the teacher, I got to make my ownlooked horrible, but tasted delicious
**pizza###5.0###
Thank you to the staff at Cici's for making our field trip so much fun
We had an educational experience but also really had a blast
Thanks
This 5 star review is based on overall experience, as opposed to culinary deliciousness, although the pizza was pretty good
**pizza###5.0###
My 4th graders and I recently took our yearly field trip to this location as part of our Fractions Unit
When we arrived, the staff was completely ready to go, despite the fact that they were swamped making the pizza orders for the local high school
**pizza###2.0###
The general manager himself happily greeted my students, took them on a personal tour of the location, and answered all their questions with patience and a smile on his face
Everything was clean, organized, and everyone was very accommodating
In regards to the food, everything was fresh, hot and tasted great
The students were all allowed to decorate their own pizzas, and the staff encouraged them to be creative with their pepperoni designs
**pizza###4.0###
**pepperoni###3.0###
I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I know the kids and I both had a great time
Pizza is normally cold and hard  tables not clean, restaurant dirty
Crowded, dirty restrooms i could go on all day
The pizza is bad, to say it nicely
**pizza###1.0###
Only good thing here is the price
 DAILY LUNCH BUFFET It's been four years since I ate at this CiCi's so it was past time to stop back in see how they're doing
**buffet###2.0###
The place has been remodeled but amazingly the price for the all you can eat feast is still the same 499, even though there is somewhat more to choose from than there used to be
 The Buffet had a generous selection of 28 items including the various help yourself salad topping fruits veggies
**salad###4.0###
**fruit###4.0###
The pasta du jour was Cellentani, I had some of it in Chicken Soup, plus Alfredo, and Marinara
**pasta###3.0###
Then after a good salad it was on to the pizzas which were mostly meatless, plus some with paper thin Pepperoni slices or about a teaspoon of sausage on the slice, plus a thin layer of melted cheese in some cases a little tomato based sauce
**salad###4.0###
**pizza###3.0###
**sausage###3.0###
**tomato###3.0###
So the pizza was weak, but everything tasted ok and you do get 499 worth of eating here, so I have to give it 3 Stars
**pizza###1.0###
With that said though, Pizza Buffet beats this outfit as well as the Peter PIper Pizza Hut Buffets around the Valley by enough to make it worth your drive up there for your occasional super cheapo Pizza Buffet pig out
**buffet###4.0###
 
Non c' problema
Whip on down to BoomBozz, 1026 S Gilbert Rd, Gilbert  
The most disgusting restaurant I've ever been to
Apparently there are no health inspectors in Glendale
See my photos got more info
Pizza is very thin
Nothing special about the taste
The crust is a bit too doughy
I'm picky when it comes to my pizza but I did enjoy the cheap price
**pizza###3.0###
Too bad you can taste it too
CiCi's Pizza is a true bargain
I'm not going to say that this is anywhere close to my favorite pizza, because it is far from it, but having said that it is much better than you would expect for the price
**pizza###4.0###
When we went the pizza was good and fresh
**pizza###5.0###
Even the desserts were tasty, which is rare for a buffet
**buffet###5.0###
If you are a really big pizza eater like me you will have a hard time finding a better value than this
I plan on visiting more
Still going there and it's a great bargain for great pizza
**pizza###5.0###
If they don't have the pizza that you want out on the buffet, just ask the staff and they will cook it up for you and bring it out to the table
**pizza###4.0###
**buffet###4.0###
Overall the staff are very nice considering the stress factor that they have to deal with from some customers with poor manners
Figure on 7 bucks for lunch pizza and soda
**pizza###4.0###

Cici's great food great bargain
Every time we go the staff is great and on top of everything
Place is clean and fun
We have been to this Cici's before and never before have we witnessed what we did tonight
We got the Cici's and had to wait for someone to come and take our money, there were no employees in site until we looked over at a table where there were 3 employees sitting, talking and joking around 
Not one of them moved to help us and it wasn't like they were busy, there were only 15 people in the store and 2 of them were us
Looking around the salad bar was a mess, there was food all over the place and salad dressing poured all over
**blueberrie###1.0###
**salad dressing###1.0###
There was minimal pizza out on the line, The pasta looked like it had been sitting there for hours, and the sauces looked like they had been there even longer than that
**pizza###3.0###
**pasta###3.0###
As you make your way down the line, the garlic bread wasn't cooked all the way, it was still raw
The pizza was cold and looked like it had been sitting there for a long time too
**pizza###3.0###
There was no deserts out at this time
Looking around the whole room was a mess
There was food all over the floor, the tables were covered with dishes and food from the people that had left before we arrived
There was stuff under the tables
And NO ONE AROUND doing anything about it
We choose our food and most of it was warm, but not hot
The salad dressing was cool but not cold
**salad dressing###3.0###
They finally did put out some pizza that was fresh out of the ovens and that was really good
**pizza###4.0###
They finally got some deserts out and it was hot and good
We sat there looking around and about 30 mins into our meal finally someone came out to clean
It took him forever to clean the tables, not because they were that dirty, but because he was that slow
No employee stayed in the front by the register for any amount of time, each time someone came in they had to wait a while before being taken care of
Employee's were more worried about eating and drinking themselves, then they were about their paying guest
We watch one employee take her cup, empty it in the soda fountain, then wash it out with the water from the soda fountain and then refill her drink
**soda###2.0###
I didn't understand why she was using this to wash her cup, as I could see the sink from where I was sitting and she could have washed her cup in the sink and then fill it up at the fountain
Then I watch the employee in the RED shirt, who I assume was in charge, take the key and met two other guest in the game room and started playing games
All the while the other employees were no where to be found
After a while the Red shirt finally left the game room and went back into the kitchen
The whole place is in need of a cleaning, because under every table was a mess of food and trash
We choose the one with the least
To my surprise I saw about 20 pizzas sitting on racks that are attached to the wall
**pizza###3.0###
I pointed it out to my husband, who went up to the bar asked about it
The girl said that they make them ahead of time and they sit on the racks for about 20 mins and they cook them
I know that's not true, because we had already been there 45 mins too long and they only took 2 pizzas off the racks in that time
**pizza###3.0###
Those pizzas sit on the wall for a long time, and who knows what's in the air
**pizza###4.0###
Also we watched an employee take a plastic bag of salad and pour it into the bin on the salad bardumping the plastic into the bin
**salad###3.0###
**bin###3.0###
Then we watched an employee wipe down the bar and then use the same rag to pick up the pizza pan and move it and then continue to wipe the bar down and then use the same rag to move the pizza back
**pizza###3.0###
We have been to this Cici's in the past, and not witnessed what we witnessed today
We will not be going back
Your employees have no business in this kind of job
We have expected the same kind of service that we have had in the past, where we were greeted when we walked in, where we were asked if there was any kind of special pizza we might like and a clean store
**pizza###4.0###
If I could have given NO stars I would
I would suggest that the OwnerManager Jack Rochelle goes to his story and clean it up
Get rid of the employees that aren't doing their job
 These people do not have your interest as a priority, they are only there for the paycheck
They don't care about your customer, they only care about having a good time
They are running your store into the ground and you are going to end up with your store being just like what happened to the store in Peoria
